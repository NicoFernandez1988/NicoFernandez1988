### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ IÂ´m Nico Fernandez, a full stack web developer.

Dedicated to the design and development of web pages for about 2 years. But i continue to learn passionately every day.

Currently I develop with 2 types of technology stacks:

The first {Bootstrap, Spring, Java and MySQL}

The second {Bootstrap, Laravel, PHP and MySQL}

I hope to upload other projects with new technologies soon.

My hobbies: Cinema ðŸŽž, videogames ðŸŽ® and traveling ðŸ›«.
